This is a resubmission. Compared to the last submission, I have:

* Cannot find the DOIs for the reference in the description section of description file, so I am using the weblink instead.
---
## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.2
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
